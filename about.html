            <p>This website is designed to offer a simple, no-frills way to generate a nicely-formatted stat block for 5th-Edition
                Dungeons and Dragons. It is currently far from complete, lacking most of its functionality. I intend to add in said
                functionality later, along with another pass at beautifying the various website elements, and adding a few limited
                quality of life features. But for now, this is what's on the table.
