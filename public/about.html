            <p>This website is designed to offer a simple, no-frills way to generate a nicely-formatted stat block for 5th-Edition Dungeons and Dragons. For most of the inputs, you'll have to handle how it's supposed to look (with parentheses and such) yourself.
                For the traits and various action sections, all text before the first period will be formatted as the "title" of that property. Press the enter key to start typing a new property.
            <p>The following actions are final, do not save your work, and have no safety prompt: <b>be careful around these buttons.</b></p>
            <ul>
                <li>Pressing the question mark takes you to this about page.</li>
                <li>Pressing the reload button returns you to the default monster creation page, regardless of what page you are on.</li>
                <li>Pressing the trash button deletes the current statblock and returns you to the statblock search page.</li>
                <li>Pressing the list button takes you to the statblock search page.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>Pressing the save button is the only button that saves your work, and allows you to continue working on it. Statblocks are saved by the name of the creature, and new saves overwrite old saves. If you want to keep
                multiple versions, iterate the name field.
            </p>
